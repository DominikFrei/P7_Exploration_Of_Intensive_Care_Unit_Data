```


# Code

## Set up

Libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load in the data set:
```{r}
data <- read.csv(file = "Data/full_cohort_data.csv")
```

Display the data structure as imported:
```{r}
str(data)
```

Our main question is: Which of the available variables in the data set are useful
for predicting death within 28 days, after the use of an indwelling arterial catheter (IAC)?

Are there sufficient records for patients on wich an IAC was used?
```{r}
table(data$aline_flg)
```
